# Extension Icons

Place the following icon files in this directory:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, the extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience.

You can create simple icons with:
- ðŸ”§ wrench emoji as the main symbol
- Blue gradient background matching the extension theme (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Clean, minimal design suitable for small sizes
